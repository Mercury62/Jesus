I could have used source code management with a hackathon project this weekend
it got very messy and we forgot the changes we made to it so we could either re add those changes or go back a version
we were using google cloud api and python code so the two different languages got very confusing
some code on previous edits had more of a desired effect than more recent code
and we had the prolem with how many people were editing it and one time so the changes gave us a headache
plus after being very sleep deprived made things worse im actually supised we didnt rip each other apart
in the end we didnt win this weekend (though if your reading this after talking to patrick or ken youll be happy to hear the results of yhack)

our project for this weekend was a google cloud api that read logos and sent out messages to peoplewho had those logos like targeted advertising but we
changed the idea for activists who wanted to change the opinion of others on a certian product
If we managed to get a version 1 of our code done and then make tiny changes and update them as a group mabye we would have been done alot quicker
but it made things take alot longer , eventually we got it done but we hated ourselves alot more after wards
honestly if i heard of this before yhack the judges might have thought alot better of our code than they did
but we learn form our mistakes
